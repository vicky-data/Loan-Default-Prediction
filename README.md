Loan Default Prediction â€“ Supervised Classification Project
Built a machine learning model to predict whether loan applicants are likely to default based on historical financial and demographic data.

Objective: Help financial institutions minimize risk by predicting loan defaults ahead of time.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Techniques: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Feature Engineering, Handling Imbalanced Data (SMOTE)

EDA Highlights: Identified key risk indicators such as income level, credit history, and loan purpose.

Results: Achieved 82% accuracy using Random Forest; improved recall through resampling.

Impact: Enables more accurate and data-driven lending decisions.
